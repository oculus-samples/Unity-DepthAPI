# 67.0.0

### Features
* Depth API is now part of Meta Core SDK and most of the scripts and shader libraries required for Depth API now live in there. For future updates and changes, refer to the [Meta Core SDK release notes](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/meta-xr-core-sdk/)
* Depth API implementation has been significantly overhauled both on the C# scripting side and the shader libraries side. More info [here](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-depthapi/)
* This package, along with `com.meta.xr.depthapi.urp` are now no longer required to support depth, but will continue to supply useful shaders and will be supported alongside the Depth API implementation from Meta Core SDK.
* Both packages have been adapted to support the Depth API implementation present in Meta Core SDK.

### Improvements
* Depth textures are now supplied using a new method from the system level. This results in better looking and significantly more optimized occlusions.
* Simplified and more straightforward API.
